# YNAB Explorer

This app pulls information in from You Need a Budget (YNAB) and converts income and expenses into a Sankey diagram.

It uses the [YNAB API](https://api.ynab.com/#hello) to pull in data and [D3](https://d3js.org/) for the Sankey chart.

## Project Setup

In order to deploy your own project, you'll first need to create an oAuth app in YNAB under developer settings.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
